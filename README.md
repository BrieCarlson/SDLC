#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs they need to be clearly defined and realistic. Laying out what the program needs to achieve. Creating user stories helps by laying out their needs but also what it is accomplishing. They allow for the documentation of details that make the requirements clear and keep focus on the user and solving problems for real users.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In the past my approach to software development was more related to the waterfall method which worked as far as assignments go. There are clear deadlines and requirements in place. Test cases are one agile process I like and could implement into my future development work. Having a clear indication of what is required to have each section completed will help keep things organized rather than jumping right into the next part as I tend to do. 

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development, communication is key. It's important to collaborate with your other team members to take feedback and quickly adapt. A good team member should also be skilled in being self-sufficient and self-organizing to achieve their goals as well as being cross-functional to balance workloads. Above all a good team member should respect and appreciate the contributions their other team members put in.
